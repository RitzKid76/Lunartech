    worldgen changes ?
    predicate based gravity (@e[predicate=DIMENSION])
    
machines
    quarry
        upgrades
    biosphere
        base orange sphere
        regulates climate
        upgrages
            size
                base 9
                each aditional -> +5
            gravity
                purple sphere
                returns everything to overworld gravity
            radiation
                pink sphere
                takes shield which takes lead
            oxygen
                blue sphere
                takes air canister
            automatic oxygen production
                can hold up to 512 oxygen cells
                made with saplings, iron, and glass
        protects against meteors
    power system
        leads as cables
        solar panels
    generator
        water condenser/recycler updrade (consumes 10% of water instead)
        requires some form of fuel unit input to run
    pulverizer
        can convert ice into cubes more efficiently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
    nuclear reactor
        creates radiation (green radiation bubble like oxegenator?)
            random tick like dry in all dimensions inside radius
        far more efficient than standard generator
        water condenser/recycler updrade (consumes 10% of water instead)
        temperature monitor
            blows up when temps are too high (large fireball explosion)
            can take ice to drop temp below water cooling threshold

mars
    worldgen
        needs enough materials to be able to play pack from planet
    gameplay
        too hot
            insulated space suit
        radiation
            lead radiation protection lining
        
moon
    worldgen
        needs enough materials to be able to play pack from planet
    gameplay
        too cold
            insulated suit
    

rocket
    tiers
        worst
            blows up in atmosphere after flying away from you for one way trip
    parachutes
        player and cockpit

items
    magnet
    motor
    gear
    ice cubes
        10 ice cubes -> 1 air canister (5m)
        blue ice -> 9 ice cubes
        packed ice -> 1 ice cube

gas vents ?
